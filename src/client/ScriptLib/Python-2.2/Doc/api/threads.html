8.1 Thread State and the Global Interpreter Lock
         
</H1>

<P>
<a name="l2h-732">&nbsp;</a>
<P>
The Python interpreter is not fully thread safe.  In order to support
multi-threaded Python programs, there's a global lock that must be
held by the current thread before it can safely access Python objects.
Without the lock, even the simplest operations could cause problems in
a multi-threaded program: for example, when two threads simultaneously
increment the reference count of the same object, the reference count
could end up being incremented only once instead of twice.

<P>
Therefore, the rule exists that only the thread that has acquired the
global interpreter lock may operate on Python objects or call Python/C
API functions.  In order to support multi-threaded Python programs,
the interpreter regularly releases and reacquires the lock -- by
default, every ten bytecode instructions (this can be changed with
<a name="l2h-707">&nbsp;</a><tt class="function">sys.setcheckinterval()</tt>).  The lock is also released and
reacquired around potentially blocking I/O operations like reading or
writing a file, so that other threads can run while the thread that
requests the I/O is waiting for the I/O operation to complete.

<P>
The Python interpreter needs to keep some bookkeeping information
separate per thread -- for this it uses a data structure called
<tt class="ctype">PyThreadState</tt><a name="l2h-733">&nbsp;</a>.  This is new in Python
1.5; in earlier versions, such state was stored in global variables,
and switching threads could cause problems.  In particular, exception
handling is now thread safe, when the application uses
<a name="l2h-709">&nbsp;</a><tt class="function">sys.exc_info()</tt> to access the exception last raised in the
current thread.

<P>
There's one global variable left, however: the pointer to the current
<tt class="ctype">PyThreadState</tt><a name="l2h-734">&nbsp;</a>structure.  While most
thread packages have a way to store ``per-thread global data,''
Python's internal platform independent thread abstraction doesn't
support this yet.  Therefore, the current thread state must be
manipulated explicitly.

<P>
This is easy enough in most cases.  Most code manipulating the global
interpreter lock has the following simple structure:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
Save the thread state in a local variable.
Release the interpreter lock.
...Do some blocking I/O operation...
Reacquire the interpreter lock.
Restore the thread state from the local variable.
</pre></dl>

<P>
This is so common that a pair of macros exists to simplify it:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS
...Do some blocking I/O operation...
Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS
</pre></dl>

<P>
The <code>Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS</code><a name="l2h-735">&nbsp;</a>macro
opens a new block and declares a hidden local variable; the
<code>Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS</code><a name="l2h-736">&nbsp;</a>macro closes 
the block.  Another advantage of using these two macros is that when
Python is compiled without thread support, they are defined empty,
thus saving the thread state and lock manipulations.

<P>
When thread support is enabled, the block above expands to the
following code:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
    PyThreadState *_save;

    _save = PyEval_SaveThread();
    ...Do some blocking I/O operation...
    PyEval_RestoreThread(_save);
</pre></dl>

<P>
Using even lower level primitives, we can get roughly the same effect
as follows:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
    PyThreadState *_save;

    _save = PyThreadState_Swap(NULL);
    PyEval_ReleaseLock();
    ...Do some blocking I/O operation...
    PyEval_AcquireLock();
    PyThreadState_Swap(_save);
</pre></dl>

<P>
There are some subtle differences; in particular,
<tt class="cfunction">PyEval_RestoreThread()</tt><a name="l2h-737">&nbsp;</a>saves
and restores the value of the  global variable
<tt class="cdata">errno</tt><a name="l2h-738">&nbsp;</a>, since the lock manipulation does not
guarantee that <tt class="cdata">errno</tt> is left alone.  Also, when thread support
is disabled,
<tt class="cfunction">PyEval_SaveThread()</tt><a name="l2h-739">&nbsp;</a>and
<tt class="cfunction">PyEval_RestoreThread()</tt> don't manipulate the lock; in this
case, <tt class="cfunction">PyEval_ReleaseLock()</tt><a name="l2h-740">&nbsp;</a>and
<tt class="cfunction">PyEval_AcquireLock()</tt><a name="l2h-741">&nbsp;</a>are not
available.  This is done so that dynamically loaded extensions
compiled with thread support enabled can be loaded by an interpreter
that was compiled with disabled thread support.

<P>
The global interpreter lock is used to protect the pointer to the
current thread state.  When releasing the lock and saving the thread
state, the current thread state pointer must be retrieved before the
lock is released (since another thread could immediately acquire the
lock and store its own thread state in the global variable).
Conversely, when acquiring the lock and restoring the thread state,
the lock must be acquired before storing the thread state pointer.

<P>
Why am I going on with so much detail about this?  Because when
threads are created from C, they don't have the global interpreter
lock, nor is there a thread state data structure for them.  Such
threads must bootstrap themselves into existence, by first creating a
thread state data structure, then acquiring the lock, and finally
storing their thread state pointer, before they can start using the
Python/C API.  When they are done, they should reset the thread state
pointer, release the lock, and finally free their thread state data
structure.

<P>
When creating a thread data structure, you need to provide an
interpreter state data structure.  The interpreter state data
structure hold global data that is shared by all threads in an
interpreter, for example the module administration
(<code>sys.modules</code>).  Depending on your needs, you can either create
a new interpreter state data structure, or share the interpreter state
data structure used by the Python main thread (to access the latter,
you must obtain the thread state and access its <tt class="member">interp</tt> member;
this must be done by a thread that is created by Python or by the main
thread after Python is initialized).

<P>
<dl><dt><b><tt class="ctype"><a name="l2h-710">PyInterpreterState</a></tt></b>
<dd>
  This data structure represents the state shared by a number of
  cooperating threads.  Threads belonging to the same interpreter
  share their module administration and a few other internal items.
  There are no public members in this structure.

<P>
Threads belonging to different interpreters initially share nothing,
  except process state like available memory, open file descriptors
  and such.  The global interpreter lock is also shared by all
  threads, regardless of to which interpreter they belong.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt><b><tt class="ctype"><a name="l2h-711">PyThreadState</a></tt></b>
<dd>
  This data structure represents the state of a single thread.  The
  only public data member is <tt class="ctype">PyInterpreterState
  *</tt><tt class="member">interp</tt>, which points to this thread's interpreter state.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>void <b><a name="l2h-712"><tt class="cfunction">PyEval_InitThreads</tt></a></b>()
<dd>
  Initialize and acquire the global interpreter lock.  It should be
  called in the main thread before creating a second thread or
  engaging in any other thread operations such as
  <tt class="cfunction">PyEval_ReleaseLock()</tt><a name="l2h-742">&nbsp;</a>or
  <code>PyEval_ReleaseThread(<var>tstate</var>)</code><a name="l2h-743">&nbsp;</a>.
  It is not needed before calling
  <tt class="cfunction">PyEval_SaveThread()</tt><a name="l2h-744">&nbsp;</a>or
  <tt class="cfunction">PyEval_RestoreThread()</tt><a name="l2h-745">&nbsp;</a>.

<P>
This is a no-op when called for a second time.  It is safe to call
  this function before calling
  <tt class="cfunction">Py_Initialize()</tt><a name="l2h-746">&nbsp;</a>.

<P>
When only the main thread exists, no lock operations are needed.
  This is a common situation (most Python programs do not use
  threads), and the lock operations slow the interpreter down a bit.
  Therefore, the lock is not created initially.  This situation is
  equivalent to having acquired the lock: when there is only a single
  thread, all object accesses are safe.  Therefore, when this function
  initializes the lock, it also acquires it.  Before the Python
  <tt class="module">thread</tt><a name="l2h-747">&nbsp;</a>module creates a new thread,
  knowing that either it has the lock or the lock hasn't been created
  yet, it calls <tt class="cfunction">PyEval_InitThreads()</tt>.  When this call
  returns, it is guaranteed that the lock has been created and that it
  has acquired it.

<P>
It is <b>not</b> safe to call this function when it is unknown
  which thread (if any) currently has the global interpreter lock.

<P>
This function is not available when thread support is disabled at
  compile time.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>void <b><a name="l2h-713"><tt class="cfunction">PyEval_AcquireLock</tt></a></b>()
<dd>
  Acquire the global interpreter lock.  The lock must have been
  created earlier.  If this thread already has the lock, a deadlock
  ensues.  This function is not available when thread support is
  disabled at compile time.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>void <b><a name="l2h-714"><tt class="cfunction">PyEval_ReleaseLock</tt></a></b>()
<dd>
  Release the global interpreter lock.  The lock must have been
  created earlier.  This function is not available when thread support
  is disabled at compile time.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>void <b><a name="l2h-715"><tt class="cfunction">PyEval_AcquireThread</tt></a></b>(<var>PyThreadState *tstate</var>)
<dd>
  Acquire the global interpreter lock and then set the current thread
  state to <var>tstate</var>, which should not be <tt class="constant">NULL</tt>.  The lock must
  have been created earlier.  If this thread already has the lock,
  deadlock ensues.  This function is not available when thread support
  is disabled at compile time.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>void <b><a name="l2h-716"><tt class="cfunction">PyEval_ReleaseThread</tt></a></b>(<var>PyThreadState *tstate</var>)
<dd>
  Reset the current thread state to <tt class="constant">NULL</tt> and release the global
  interpreter lock.  The lock must have been created earlier and must
  be held by the current thread.  The <var>tstate</var> argument, which
  must not be <tt class="constant">NULL</tt>, is only used to check that it represents the
  current thread state -- if it isn't, a fatal error is reported.
  This function is not available when thread support is disabled at
  compile time.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>PyThreadState* <b><a name="l2h-717"><tt class="cfunction">PyEval_SaveThread</tt></a></b>()
<dd>
  Release the interpreter lock (if it has been created and thread
  support is enabled) and reset the thread state to <tt class="constant">NULL</tt>, returning
  the previous thread state (which is not <tt class="constant">NULL</tt>).  If the lock has
  been created, the current thread must have acquired it.  (This
  function is available even when thread support is disabled at
  compile time.)
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>void <b><a name="l2h-718"><tt class="cfunction">PyEval_RestoreThread</tt></a></b>(<var>PyThreadState *tstate</var>)
<dd>
  Acquire the interpreter lock (if it has been created and thread
  support is enabled) and set the thread state to <var>tstate</var>, which
  must not be <tt class="constant">NULL</tt>.  If the lock has been created, the current thread
  must not have acquired it, otherwise deadlock ensues.  (This
  function is available even when thread support is disabled at
  compile time.)
</dl>

<P>
The following macros are normally used without a trailing semicolon;
look for example usage in the Python source distribution.

<P>
<dl><dt><b><a name="l2h-719"><tt class="macro">Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS</tt></a></b>
<dd>
  This macro expands to
  "<tt class="samp">{ PyThreadState *_save; _save = PyEval_SaveThread();</tt>".
  Note that it contains an opening brace; it must be matched with a
  following <code>Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS</code> macro.  See above for further
  discussion of this macro.  It is a no-op when thread support is
  disabled at compile time.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt><b><a name="l2h-720"><tt class="macro">Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS</tt></a></b>
<dd>
  This macro expands to "<tt class="samp">PyEval_RestoreThread(_save); }</tt>".
  Note that it contains a closing brace; it must be matched with an
  earlier <code>Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS</code> macro.  See above for further
  discussion of this macro.  It is a no-op when thread support is
  disabled at compile time.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt><b><a name="l2h-721"><tt class="macro">Py_BLOCK_THREADS</tt></a></b>
<dd>
  This macro expands to "<tt class="samp">PyEval_RestoreThread(_save);</tt>": it is
  equivalent to <code>Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS</code> without the closing brace.
  It is a no-op when thread support is disabled at compile time.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt><b><a name="l2h-722"><tt class="macro">Py_UNBLOCK_THREADS</tt></a></b>
<dd>
  This macro expands to "<tt class="samp">_save = PyEval_SaveThread();</tt>": it is
  equivalent to <code>Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS</code> without the opening
  brace and variable declaration.  It is a no-op when thread support
  is disabled at compile time.
</dl>

<P>
All of the following functions are only available when thread support
is enabled at compile time, and must be called only when the
interpreter lock has been created.

<P>
<dl><dt>PyInterpreterState* <b><a name="l2h-723"><tt class="cfunction">PyInterpreterState_New</tt></a></b>()
<dd>
  Create a new interpreter state object.  The interpreter lock need
  not be held, but may be held if it is necessary to serialize calls
  to this function.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>void <b><a name="l2h-724"><tt class="cfunction">PyInterpreterState_Clear</tt></a></b>(<var>PyInterpreterState *interp</var>)
<dd>
  Reset all information in an interpreter state object.  The
  interpreter lock must be held.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>void <b><a name="l2h-725"><tt class="cfunction">PyInterpreterState_Delete</tt></a></b>(<var>PyInterpreterState *interp</var>)
<dd>
  Destroy an interpreter state object.  The interpreter lock need not
  be held.  The interpreter state must have been reset with a previous
  call to <tt class="cfunction">PyInterpreterState_Clear()</tt>.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>PyThreadState* <b><a name="l2h-726"><tt class="cfunction">PyThreadState_New</tt></a></b>(<var>PyInterpreterState *interp</var>)
<dd>
  Create a new thread state object belonging to the given interpreter
  object.  The interpreter lock need not be held, but may be held if
  it is necessary to serialize calls to this function.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>void <b><a name="l2h-727"><tt class="cfunction">PyThreadState_Clear</tt></a></b>(<var>PyThreadState *tstate</var>)
<dd>
  Reset all information in a thread state object.  The interpreter lock
  must be held.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>void <b><a name="l2h-728"><tt class="cfunction">PyThreadState_Delete</tt></a></b>(<var>PyThreadState *tstate</var>)
<dd>
  Destroy a thread state object.  The interpreter lock need not be
  held.  The thread state must have been reset with a previous call to
  <tt class="cfunction">PyThreadState_Clear()</tt>.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>PyThreadState* <b><a name="l2h-729"><tt class="cfunction">PyThreadState_Get</tt></a></b>()
<dd>
  Return the current thread state.  The interpreter lock must be
  held.  When the current thread state is <tt class="constant">NULL</tt>, this issues a fatal
  error (so that the caller needn't check for <tt class="constant">NULL</tt>).
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>PyThreadState* <b><a name="l2h-730"><tt class="cfunction">PyThreadState_Swap</tt></a></b>(<var>PyThreadState *tstate</var>)
<dd>
  Swap the current thread state with the thread state given by the
  argument <var>tstate</var>, which may be <tt class="constant">NULL</tt>.  The interpreter lock
  must be held.
</dl>

<P>
<dl><dt>PyObject* <b><a name="l2h-731"><tt class="cfunction">PyThreadState_GetDict</tt></a></b>()
<dd>
<div class="refcount-info">
  <span class="label">Return value:</span>
  <span class="value">Borrowed reference.</span>
</div>
  Return a dictionary in which extensions can store thread-specific
  state information.  Each extension should use a unique key to use to
  store state in the dictionary.  If this function returns <tt class="constant">NULL</tt>, an
  exception has been raised and the caller should allow it to
  propogate.
