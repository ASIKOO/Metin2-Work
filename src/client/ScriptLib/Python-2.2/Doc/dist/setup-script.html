3 Writing the Setup Script
</H1>

<P>
The setup script is the centre of all activity in building,
distributing, and installing modules using the Distutils.  The main
purpose of the setup script is to describe your module distribution to
the Distutils, so that the various commands that operate on your modules
do the right thing.  As we saw in section&nbsp;<A href="simple-example.html#simple-example">2.1</A> above,
the setup script consists mainly of a call to <tt class="function">setup()</tt>, and
most information supplied to the Distutils by the module developer is
supplied as keyword arguments to <tt class="function">setup()</tt>.

<P>
Here's a slightly more involved example, which we'll follow for the next
couple of sections: the Distutils' own setup script.  (Keep in mind that
although the Distutils are included with Python 1.6 and later, they also
have an independent existence so that Python 1.5.2 users can use them to
install other module distributions.  The Distutils' own setup script,
shown here, is used to install the package into Python 1.5.2.)

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
#!/usr/bin/env python

from distutils.core import setup

setup(name="Distutils",
      version="1.0",
      description="Python Distribution Utilities",
      author="Greg Ward",
      author_email="gward@python.net",
      url="http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/",
      packages=['distutils', 'distutils.command'],
     )
</pre></dl>

<P>
There are only two differences between this and the trivial one-file
distribution presented in section&nbsp;<A href="simple-example.html#simple-example">2.1</A>: more
meta-data, and the specification of pure Python modules by package,
rather than by module.  This is important since the Distutils consist of
a couple of dozen modules split into (so far) two packages; an explicit
list of every module would be tedious to generate and difficult to
maintain.

<P>
Note that any pathnames (files or directories) supplied in the setup
script should be written using the Unix convention, i.e.
slash-separated.  The Distutils will take care of converting this
platform-neutral representation into whatever is appropriate on your
current platform before actually using the pathname.  This makes your
setup script portable across operating systems, which of course is one
of the major goals of the Distutils.  In this spirit, all pathnames in
this document are slash-separated (MacOS programmers should keep in
mind that the <i>absence</i> of a leading slash indicates a relative
path, the opposite of the MacOS convention with colons).

<P>
This, of course, only applies to pathnames given to Distutils functions.
If you, for example, use standard python functions such as glob.glob
or os.listdir to specify files, you should be careful to write portable
code instead of hardcoding path separators:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
    glob.glob(os.path.join('mydir', 'subdir', '*.html'))
    os.listdir(os.path.join('mydir', 'subdir'))
</pre></dl>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000310000000000000000">&nbsp;</A>
<BR>
3.1 Listing whole packages
</H2>

<P>
The <font face="sans-serif">packages</font> option tells the Distutils to process (build,
distribute, install, etc.) all pure Python modules found in each package
mentioned in the <font face="sans-serif">packages</font> list.  In order to do this, of
course, there has to be a correspondence between package names and
directories in the filesystem.  The default correspondence is the most
obvious one, i.e. package <tt class="module">distutils</tt> is found in the directory
<span class="file">distutils</span> relative to the distribution root.  Thus, when you say
<code>packages = ['foo']</code> in your setup script, you are promising that
the Distutils will find a file <span class="file">foo/__init__.py</span> (which might
be spelled differently on your system, but you get the idea) relative to
the directory where your setup script lives.  (If you break this
promise, the Distutils will issue a warning but process the broken
package anyways.)

<P>
If you use a different convention to lay out your source directory,
that's no problem: you just have to supply the <font face="sans-serif">package_dir</font>
option to tell the Distutils about your convention.  For example, say
you keep all Python source under <span class="file">lib</span>, so that modules in the
``root package'' (i.e., not in any package at all) are right in
<span class="file">lib</span>, modules in the <tt class="module">foo</tt> package are in <span class="file">lib/foo</span>,
and so forth.  Then you would put

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
package_dir = {'': 'lib'}
</pre></dl>

<P>
in your setup script.  (The keys to this dictionary are package names,
and an empty package name stands for the root package.  The values are
directory names relative to your distribution root.)  In this case, when
you say <code>packages = ['foo']</code>, you are promising that the file
<span class="file">lib/foo/__init__.py</span> exists.

<P>
Another possible convention is to put the <tt class="module">foo</tt> package right in 
<span class="file">lib</span>, the <tt class="module">foo.bar</tt> package in <span class="file">lib/bar</span>, etc.  This
would be written in the setup script as

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
package_dir = {'foo': 'lib'}
</pre></dl>

<P>
A <code><var>package</var>: <var>dir</var></code> entry in the <font face="sans-serif">package_dir</font>
dictionary implicitly applies to all packages below <var>package</var>, so
the <tt class="module">foo.bar</tt> case is automatically handled here.  In this
example, having <code>packages = ['foo', 'foo.bar']</code> tells the Distutils
to look for <span class="file">lib/__init__.py</span> and
<span class="file">lib/bar/__init__.py</span>.  (Keep in mind that although
<font face="sans-serif">package_dir</font> applies recursively, you must explicitly list all
packages in <font face="sans-serif">packages</font>: the Distutils will <i>not</i> recursively
scan your source tree looking for any directory with an
<span class="file">__init__.py</span> file.)

<P>

<BR>
3.2 Listing individual modules
</H2>

<P>
For a small module distribution, you might prefer to list all modules
rather than listing packages--especially the case of a single module
that goes in the ``root package'' (i.e., no package at all).  This
simplest case was shown in section&nbsp;<A href="simple-example.html#simple-example">2.1</A>; here is a
slightly more involved example:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
py_modules = ['mod1', 'pkg.mod2']
</pre></dl>

<P>
This describes two modules, one of them in the ``root'' package, the
other in the <tt class="module">pkg</tt> package.  Again, the default package/directory
layout implies that these two modules can be found in <span class="file">mod1.py</span> and
<span class="file">pkg/mod2.py</span>, and that <span class="file">pkg/__init__.py</span> exists as well.
And again, you can override the package/directory correspondence using
the <font face="sans-serif">package_dir</font> option.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000330000000000000000">&nbsp;</A>
<BR>
3.3 Describing extension modules
</H2>

<P>
Just as writing Python extension modules is a bit more complicated than
writing pure Python modules, describing them to the Distutils is a bit
more complicated.  Unlike pure modules, it's not enough just to list
modules or packages and expect the Distutils to go out and find the
right files; you have to specify the extension name, source file(s), and
any compile/link requirements (include directories, libraries to link
with, etc.).

<P>
All of this is done through another keyword argument to
<tt class="function">setup()</tt>, the <font face="sans-serif">extensions</font> option.  <font face="sans-serif">extensions</font>
is just a list of <tt class="class">Extension</tt> instances, each of which describes a
single extension module.  Suppose your distribution includes a single
extension, called <tt class="module">foo</tt> and implemented by <span class="file">foo.c</span>.  If no
additional instructions to the compiler/linker are needed, describing
this extension is quite simple:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
Extension("foo", ["foo.c"])
</pre></dl>

<P>
The <tt class="class">Extension</tt> class can be imported from
<tt class="module">distutils.core</tt>, along with <tt class="function">setup()</tt>.  Thus, the setup
script for a module distribution that contains only this one extension
and nothing else might be:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
from distutils.core import setup, Extension
setup(name="foo", version="1.0",
      ext_modules=[Extension("foo", ["foo.c"])])
</pre></dl>

<P>
The <tt class="class">Extension</tt> class (actually, the underlying extension-building
machinery implemented by the <code>build_ext</code> command) supports a
great deal of flexibility in describing Python extensions, which is
explained in the following sections.  

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000331000000000000000">
3.3.1 Extension names and packages</A>
</H3>

<P>
The first argument to the <tt class="class">Extension</tt> constructor is always the
name of the extension, including any package names.  For example,

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
Extension("foo", ["src/foo1.c", "src/foo2.c"])
</pre></dl>

<P>
describes an extension that lives in the root package, while

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
Extension("pkg.foo", ["src/foo1.c", "src/foo2.c"])
</pre></dl>

<P>
describes the same extension in the <tt class="module">pkg</tt> package.  The source
files and resulting object code are identical in both cases; the only
difference is where in the filesystem (and therefore where in Python's
namespace hierarchy) the resulting extension lives.

<P>
If you have a number of extensions all in the same package (or all under
the same base package), use the <font face="sans-serif">ext_package</font> keyword argument
to <tt class="function">setup()</tt>.  For example,

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
setup(...
      ext_package="pkg",
      ext_modules=[Extension("foo", ["foo.c"]),
                   Extension("subpkg.bar", ["bar.c"])]
     )
</pre></dl>

<P>
will compile <span class="file">foo.c</span> to the extension <tt class="module">pkg.foo</tt>, and
<span class="file">bar.c</span> to <tt class="module">pkg.subpkg.bar</tt>.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000332000000000000000">
3.3.2 Extension source files</A>
</H3>

<P>
The second argument to the <tt class="class">Extension</tt> constructor is a list of
source files.  Since the Distutils currently only support C/C++
extensions, these are normally C/C++ source files.  (Be sure to use
appropriate extensions to distinguish C++ source files: <span class="file">.cc</span> and
<span class="file">.cpp</span> seem to be recognized by both Unix and Windows compilers.)

<P>
However, you can also include SWIG interface (<span class="file">.i</span>) files in the
list; the <code>build_ext</code> command knows how to deal with SWIG
extensions: it will run SWIG on the interface file and compile the
resulting C/C++ file into your extension.

<P>
<b>** SWIG support is rough around the edges and largely untested;
  especially SWIG support of C++ extensions!  Explain in more detail
  here when the interface firms up. **</b>

<P>
On some platforms, you can include non-source files that are processed
by the compiler and included in your extension.  Currently, this just
means Windows message text (<span class="file">.mc</span>) files and resource definition
(<span class="file">.rc</span>) files for Visual C++. These will be compiled to binary resource
(<span class="file">.res</span>) files and linked into the executable.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000333000000000000000">
3.3.3 Preprocessor options</A>
</H3>

<P>
Three optional arguments to <tt class="class">Extension</tt> will help if you need to
specify include directories to search or preprocessor macros to
define/undefine: <code>include_dirs</code>, <code>define_macros</code>, and
<code>undef_macros</code>.

<P>
For example, if your extension requires header files in the
<span class="file">include</span> directory under your distribution root, use the
<code>include_dirs</code> option:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
Extension("foo", ["foo.c"], include_dirs=["include"])
</pre></dl>

<P>
You can specify absolute directories there; if you know that your
extension will only be built on Unix systems with X11R6 installed to
<span class="file">/usr</span>, you can get away with

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
Extension("foo", ["foo.c"], include_dirs=["/usr/include/X11"])
</pre></dl>

<P>
You should avoid this sort of non-portable usage if you plan to
distribute your code: it's probably better to write your code to include
(e.g.) <code>&lt;X11/Xlib.h&gt;</code>.

<P>
If you need to include header files from some other Python extension,
you can take advantage of the fact that the Distutils install extension
header files in a consistent way.  For example, the Numerical Python
header files are installed (on a standard Unix installation) to
<span class="file">/usr/local/include/python1.5/Numerical</span>.  (The exact location will
differ according to your platform and Python installation.)  Since the
Python include directory--<span class="file">/usr/local/include/python1.5</span> in this
case--is always included in the search path when building Python
extensions, the best approach is to include (e.g.)
<code>&lt;Numerical/arrayobject.h&gt;</code>.  If you insist on putting the
<span class="file">Numerical</span> include directory right into your header search path,
though, you can find that directory using the Distutils
<tt class="module">sysconfig</tt> module:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_inc
incdir = os.path.join(get_python_inc(plat_specific=1), "Numerical")
setup(...,
      Extension(..., include_dirs=[incdir]))
</pre></dl>

<P>
Even though this is quite portable--it will work on any Python
installation, regardless of platform--it's probably easier to just
write your C code in the sensible way.

<P>
You can define and undefine pre-processor macros with the
<code>define_macros</code> and <code>undef_macros</code> options.
<code>define_macros</code> takes a list of <code>(name, value)</code> tuples, where
<code>name</code> is the name of the macro to define (a string) and
<code>value</code> is its value: either a string or <code>None</code>.  (Defining a
macro <code>FOO</code> to <code>None</code> is the equivalent of a bare
<code>#define FOO</code> in your C source: with most compilers, this sets
<code>FOO</code> to the string <code>1</code>.)  <code>undef_macros</code> is just
a list of macros to undefine.

<P>
For example:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
Extension(...,
          define_macros=[('NDEBUG', '1')],
                         ('HAVE_STRFTIME', None),
          undef_macros=['HAVE_FOO', 'HAVE_BAR'])
</pre></dl>

<P>
is the equivalent of having this at the top of every C source file:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
#define NDEBUG 1
#define HAVE_STRFTIME
#undef HAVE_FOO
#undef HAVE_BAR
</pre></dl>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000334000000000000000">
3.3.4 Library options</A>
</H3>

<P>
You can also specify the libraries to link against when building your
extension, and the directories to search for those libraries.  The
<code>libraries</code> option is a list of libraries to link against,
<code>library_dirs</code> is a list of directories to search for libraries at 
link-time, and <code>runtime_library_dirs</code> is a list of directories to 
search for shared (dynamically loaded) libraries at run-time.

<P>
For example, if you need to link against libraries known to be in the
standard library search path on target systems

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
Extension(...,
          libraries=["gdbm", "readline"])
</pre></dl>

<P>
If you need to link with libraries in a non-standard location, you'll
have to include the location in <code>library_dirs</code>:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
Extension(...,
          library_dirs=["/usr/X11R6/lib"],
          libraries=["X11", "Xt"])
</pre></dl>

<P>
(Again, this sort of non-portable construct should be avoided if you
intend to distribute your code.)

<P>
<b>** Should mention clib libraries here or somewhere else! **</b>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000335000000000000000">
3.3.5 Other options</A>
</H3>

<P>
There are still some other options which can be used to handle special
cases.

<P>
The <font face="sans-serif">extra_objects</font> option is a list of object files to be passed
to the linker. These files must not have extensions, as the default
extension for the compiler is used.

<P>
<font face="sans-serif">extra_compile_args</font> and <font face="sans-serif">extra_link_args</font> can be used
to specify additional command line options for the compiler resp.
the linker command line.

<P>
<font face="sans-serif">export_symbols</font> is only useful on windows, it can contain a list
of symbols (functions or variables) to be exported. This option
is not needed when building compiled extensions: the <code>initmodule</code>
function will automatically be added to the exported symbols list
by Distutils.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000340000000000000000">
3.4 Listing scripts</A>
</H2>
So far we have been dealing with pure and non-pure Python modules,
which are usually not run by themselves but imported by scripts.

<P>
Scripts are files containing Python source code, indended to be started
from the command line.
Distutils doesn't provide much functionality for the scripts: the only
support Distutils gives is to adjust the first line of the script
if it starts with <code>#!</code> and contains the word ``python'' to refer
to the current interpreter location.

<P>
The <font face="sans-serif">scripts</font> option simply is a list of files to be handled
in this way.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000350000000000000000">
3.5 Listing additional files</A>
</H2>

<P>
The <font face="sans-serif">data_files</font> option can be used to specify additional
files needed by the module distribution: configuration files,
data files, anything which does not fit in the previous categories.

<P>
<font face="sans-serif">data_files</font> specify a sequence of <code>(directory, files)</code>
pairs in the following way:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
setup(...
      data_files=[('bitmaps', ['bm/b1.gif', 'bm/b2.gif']),
                  ('config', ['cfg/data.cfg'])])
</pre></dl>

<P>
Note that you can specify the directory names where the data files
will be installed, but you cannot rename the data files themselves.

<P>
You can specify the <font face="sans-serif">data_files</font> options as a simple sequence
of files without specifying a target directory, but this is not recommended,
and the <code>install</code> command will print a warning in this case.
To install data files directly in the target directory, an empty
string should be given as the directory.
