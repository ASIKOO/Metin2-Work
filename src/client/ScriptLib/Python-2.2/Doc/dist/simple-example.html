2 Concepts &amp; Terminology
</H1>

<P>
Using the Distutils is quite simple, both for module developers and for
users/administrators installing third-party modules.  As a developer,
your responsibilities (apart from writing solid, well-documented and
well-tested code, of course!) are:

<UL>
<LI>write a setup script (<span class="file">setup.py</span> by convention)
</LI>
<LI>(optional) write a setup configuration file
</LI>
<LI>create a source distribution
</LI>
<LI>(optional) create one or more built (binary) distributions
</LI>
</UL>
Each of these tasks is covered in this document.

<P>
Not all module developers have access to a multitude of platforms, so
it's not always feasible to expect them to create a multitude of built
distributions.  It is hoped that a class of intermediaries, called
<i>packagers</i>, will arise to address this need.  Packagers will take
source distributions released by module developers, build them on one or
more platforms, and release the resulting built distributions.  Thus,
users on the most popular platforms will be able to install most popular
Python module distributions in the most natural way for their platform,
without having to run a single setup script or compile a line of code.

<P>

2.1 A simple example
</H2>

<P>
The setup script is usually quite simple, although since it's written in
Python, there are no arbitrary limits to what you can do with
it.<A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="#foot684"><SUP>1</SUP></A>  If
all you want to do is distribute a module called <tt class="module">foo</tt>, contained
in a file <span class="file">foo.py</span>, then your setup script can be as little as
this:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
from distutils.core import setup
setup(name="foo",
      version="1.0",
      py_modules=["foo"])
</pre></dl>

<P>
Some observations:

<UL>
<LI>most information that you supply to the Distutils is supplied as
  keyword arguments to the <tt class="function">setup()</tt> function
</LI>
<LI>those keyword arguments fall into two categories: package
  meta-data (name, version number) and information about what's in the
  package (a list of pure Python modules, in this case)
</LI>
<LI>modules are specified by module name, not filename (the same will
  hold true for packages and extensions)
</LI>
<LI>it's recommended that you supply a little more meta-data, in
  particular your name, email address and a URL for the project
  (see section&nbsp;<A href="setup-script.html#setup-script">3</A> for an example)
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
To create a source distribution for this module, you would create a
setup script, <span class="file">setup.py</span>, containing the above code, and run:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
python setup.py sdist
</pre></dl>

<P>
which will create an archive file (e.g., tarball on Unix, ZIP file on
Windows) containing your setup script, <span class="file">setup.py</span>, and your module,
<span class="file">foo.py</span>.  The archive file will be named <span class="file">Foo-1.0.tar.gz</span> (or
<span class="file">.zip</span>), and will unpack into a directory <span class="file">Foo-1.0</span>.

<P>
If an end-user wishes to install your <tt class="module">foo</tt> module, all she has
to do is download <span class="file">Foo-1.0.tar.gz</span> (or <span class="file">.zip</span>), unpack it,
and--from the <span class="file">Foo-1.0</span> directory--run

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
python setup.py install
</pre></dl>

<P>
which will ultimately copy <span class="file">foo.py</span> to the appropriate directory
for third-party modules in their Python installation.

<P>
This simple example demonstrates some fundamental concepts of the
Distutils: first, both developers and installers have the same basic
user interface, i.e. the setup script.  The difference is which
Distutils <i>commands</i> they use: the <code>sdist</code> command is
almost exclusively for module developers, while <code>install</code> is
more often for installers (although most developers will want to install
their own code occasionally).

<P>
If you want to make things really easy for your users, you can create
one or more built distributions for them.  For instance, if you are
running on a Windows machine, and want to make things easy for other
Windows users, you can create an executable installer (the most
appropriate type of built distribution for this platform) with the
<code>bdist_wininst</code> command.  For example:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
python setup.py bdist_wininst
</pre></dl>

<P>
will create an executable installer, <span class="file">Foo-1.0.win32.exe</span>, in the
current directory.

<P>
Currently (Distutils 0.9.2), the only other useful built
distribution format is RPM, implemented by the <code>bdist_rpm</code>
command.  For example, the following command will create an RPM file
called <span class="file">Foo-1.0.noarch.rpm</span>:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
python setup.py bdist_rpm
</pre></dl>

<P>
(This uses the <code>rpm</code> command, so has to be run on an RPM-based
system such as Red Hat Linux, SuSE Linux, or Mandrake Linux.)

<P>
You can find out what distribution formats are available at any time by
running

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
python setup.py bdist --help-formats
</pre></dl>

2.2 General Python terminology
</H2>

<P>
If you're reading this document, you probably have a good idea of what
modules, extensions, and so forth are.  Nevertheless, just to be sure
that everyone is operating from a common starting point, we offer the
following glossary of common Python terms:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>module</STRONG></DT>
<DD>the basic unit of code reusability in Python: a block of
  code imported by some other code.  Three types of modules concern us
  here: pure Python modules, extension modules, and packages.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>pure Python module</STRONG></DT>
<DD>a module written in Python and contained in a
  single <span class="file">.py</span> file (and possibly associated <span class="file">.pyc</span> and/or
  <span class="file">.pyo</span> files).  Sometimes referred to as a ``pure module.''
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>extension module</STRONG></DT>
<DD>a module written in the low-level language of
  the Python implementation: C/C++ for Python, Java for JPython.
  Typically contained in a single dynamically loadable pre-compiled
  file, e.g. a shared object (<span class="file">.so</span>) file for Python extensions on
  Unix, a DLL (given the <span class="file">.pyd</span> extension) for Python extensions
  on Windows, or a Java class file for JPython extensions.  (Note that
  currently, the Distutils only handles C/C++ extensions for Python.)
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>package</STRONG></DT>
<DD>a module that contains other modules; typically contained
  in a directory in the filesystem and distinguished from other
  directories by the presence of a file <span class="file">__init__.py</span>.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>root package</STRONG></DT>
<DD>the root of the hierarchy of packages.  (This isn't
  really a package, since it doesn't have an <span class="file">__init__.py</span>
  file.  But we have to call it something.)  The vast majority of the
  standard library is in the root package, as are many small, standalone
  third-party modules that don't belong to a larger module collection.
  Unlike regular packages, modules in the root package can be found in
  many directories: in fact, every directory listed in <code>sys.path</code>
  can contribute modules to the root package.
</DD>
</DL>

2.3 Distutils-specific terminology
</H2>

<P>
The following terms apply more specifically to the domain of
distributing Python modules using the Distutils:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>module distribution</STRONG></DT>
<DD>a collection of Python modules distributed
  together as a single downloadable resource and meant to be installed
  <i>en masse</i>.  Examples of some well-known module distributions are
  Numeric Python, PyXML, PIL (the Python Imaging Library), or
  mxDateTime.  (This would be called a <i>package</i>, except that term
  is already taken in the Python context: a single module distribution
  may contain zero, one, or many Python packages.)
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>pure module distribution</STRONG></DT>
<DD>a module distribution that contains only
  pure Python modules and packages.  Sometimes referred to as a ``pure
  distribution.''
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>non-pure module distribution</STRONG></DT>
<DD>a module distribution that contains
  at least one extension module.  Sometimes referred to as a ``non-pure
  distribution.''
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>distribution root</STRONG></DT>
<DD>the top-level directory of your source tree (or 
  source distribution); the directory where <span class="file">setup.py</span> exists and
  is run from
</DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="foot684">...
it.</A><A NAME="foot684"
 href="simple-example.html#tex2html1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
<DD>But be careful about putting arbitrarily expensive
  operations in your setup script; unlike, say, Autoconf-style configure
  scripts, the setup script may be run multiple times in the course of
  building and installing your module distribution.  If you need to
  insert potentially expensive processing steps into the Distutils
  chain, see section&nbsp;<A HREF="#extending"><tex2html_cross_ref_visible_mark></A> on extending the Distutils.
