2.1 The Basics
    
</H1>

<P>
The Python runtime sees all Python objects as variables of type
<tt class="ctype">PyObject*</tt>.  A <tt class="ctype">PyObject</tt> is not a very magnificent
object - it just contains the refcount and a pointer to the object's
``type object''.  This is where the action is; the type object
determines which (C) functions get called when, for instance, an
attribute gets looked up on an object or it is multiplied by another
object.  I call these C functions ``type methods'' to distinguish them
from things like <code>[].append</code> (which I will call ``object
methods'' when I get around to them).

<P>
So, if you want to define a new object type, you need to create a new
type object.

<P>
This sort of thing can only be explained by example, so here's a
minimal, but complete, module that defines a new type:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
#include &lt;Python.h&gt;

staticforward PyTypeObject noddy_NoddyType;

typedef struct {
    PyObject_HEAD
} noddy_NoddyObject;

static PyObject*
noddy_new_noddy(PyObject* self, PyObject* args)
{
    noddy_NoddyObject* noddy;

    if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args,":new_noddy")) 
        return NULL;

    noddy = PyObject_New(noddy_NoddyObject, &amp;noddy_NoddyType);

    return (PyObject*)noddy;
}

static void
noddy_noddy_dealloc(PyObject* self)
{
    PyObject_Del(self);
}

static PyTypeObject noddy_NoddyType = {
    PyObject_HEAD_INIT(NULL)
    0,
    "Noddy",
    sizeof(noddy_NoddyObject),
    0,
    noddy_noddy_dealloc, /*tp_dealloc*/
    0,          /*tp_print*/
    0,          /*tp_getattr*/
    0,          /*tp_setattr*/
    0,          /*tp_compare*/
    0,          /*tp_repr*/
    0,          /*tp_as_number*/
    0,          /*tp_as_sequence*/
    0,          /*tp_as_mapping*/
    0,          /*tp_hash */
};

static PyMethodDef noddy_methods[] = {
    {"new_noddy", noddy_new_noddy, METH_VARARGS,
     "Create a new Noddy object."},
    {NULL, NULL, 0, NULL}
};

DL_EXPORT(void)
initnoddy(void) 
{
    noddy_NoddyType.ob_type = &amp;PyType_Type;

    Py_InitModule("noddy", noddy_methods);
}
</pre></dl>

<P>
Now that's quite a bit to take in at once, but hopefully bits will
seem familiar from the last chapter.

<P>
The first bit that will be new is:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
staticforward PyTypeObject noddy_NoddyType;
</pre></dl>

<P>
This names the type object that will be defining further down in the
file.  It can't be defined here because its definition has to refer to
functions that have no yet been defined, but we need to be able to
refer to it, hence the declaration.

<P>
The <code>staticforward</code> is required to placate various brain dead
compilers.

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
typedef struct {
    PyObject_HEAD
} noddy_NoddyObject;
</pre></dl>

<P>
This is what a Noddy object will contain.  In this case nothing more
than every Python object contains - a refcount and a pointer to a type
object.  These are the fields the <code>PyObject_HEAD</code> macro brings
in.  The reason for the macro is to standardize the layout and to
enable special debugging fields to be brought in debug builds.

<P>
For contrast

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
typedef struct {
    PyObject_HEAD
    long ob_ival;
} PyIntObject;
</pre></dl>

<P>
is the corresponding definition for standard Python integers.

<P>
Next up is:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
static PyObject*
noddy_new_noddy(PyObject* self, PyObject* args)
{
    noddy_NoddyObject* noddy;

    if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args,":new_noddy")) 
        return NULL;

    noddy = PyObject_New(noddy_NoddyObject, &amp;noddy_NoddyType);

    return (PyObject*)noddy;
}
</pre></dl>

<P>
This is in fact just a regular module function, as described in the
last chapter.  The reason it gets special mention is that this is
where we create our Noddy object.  Defining PyTypeObject structures is
all very well, but if there's no way to actually <i>create</i> one
of the wretched things it is not going to do anyone much good.

<P>
Almost always, you create objects with a call of the form:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
PyObject_New(&lt;type&gt;, &amp;&lt;type object&gt;);
</pre></dl>

<P>
This allocates the memory and then initializes the object (sets
the reference count to one, makes the <tt class="cdata">ob_type</tt> pointer point at
the right place and maybe some other stuff, depending on build options).
You <i>can</i> do these steps separately if you have some reason to
-- but at this level we don't bother.

<P>
We cast the return value to a <tt class="ctype">PyObject*</tt> because that's what
the Python runtime expects.  This is safe because of guarantees about
the layout of structures in the C standard, and is a fairly common C
programming trick.  One could declare <tt class="cfunction">noddy_new_noddy</tt> to
return a <tt class="ctype">noddy_NoddyObject*</tt> and then put a cast in the
definition of <tt class="cdata">noddy_methods</tt> further down the file -- it
doesn't make much difference.

<P>
Now a Noddy object doesn't do very much and so doesn't need to
implement many type methods.  One you can't avoid is handling
deallocation, so we find

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
static void
noddy_noddy_dealloc(PyObject* self)
{
    PyObject_Del(self);
}
</pre></dl>

<P>
This is so short as to be self explanatory.  This function will be
called when the reference count on a Noddy object reaches <code>0</code> (or
it is found as part of an unreachable cycle by the cyclic garbage
collector).  <tt class="cfunction">PyObject_Del()</tt> is what you call when you want
an object to go away.  If a Noddy object held references to other
Python objects, one would decref them here.

<P>
Moving on, we come to the crunch -- the type object.

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
static PyTypeObject noddy_NoddyType = {
    PyObject_HEAD_INIT(NULL)
    0,
    "Noddy",
    sizeof(noddy_NoddyObject),
    0,
    noddy_noddy_dealloc, /*tp_dealloc*/
    0,                   /*tp_print*/
    0,                   /*tp_getattr*/
    0,                   /*tp_setattr*/
    0,                   /*tp_compare*/
    0,                   /*tp_repr*/
    0,                   /*tp_as_number*/
    0,                   /*tp_as_sequence*/
    0,                   /*tp_as_mapping*/
    0,                   /*tp_hash */
};
</pre></dl>

<P>
Now if you go and look up the definition of <tt class="ctype">PyTypeObject</tt> in
<span class="file">object.h</span> you'll see that it has many, many more fields that the
definition above.  The remaining fields will be filled with zeros by
the C compiler, and it's common practice to not specify them
explicitly unless you need them.  

<P>
This is so important that I'm going to pick the top of it apart still
further:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
    PyObject_HEAD_INIT(NULL)
</pre></dl>

<P>
This line is a bit of a wart; what we'd like to write is:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
    PyObject_HEAD_INIT(&amp;PyType_Type)
</pre></dl>

<P>
as the type of a type object is ``type'', but this isn't strictly
conforming C and some compilers complain.  So instead we fill in the
<tt class="cdata">ob_type</tt> field of <tt class="cdata">noddy_NoddyType</tt> at the earliest
oppourtunity -- in <tt class="cfunction">initnoddy()</tt>.

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
    0,
</pre></dl>

<P>
XXX why does the type info struct start PyObject_*VAR*_HEAD??

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
    "Noddy",
</pre></dl>

<P>
The name of our type.  This will appear in the default textual
representation of our objects and in some error messages, for example:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
&gt;&gt;&gt; "" + noddy.new_noddy()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?
TypeError: cannot add type "Noddy" to string
</pre></dl>

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
    sizeof(noddy_NoddyObject),
</pre></dl>

<P>
This is so that Python knows how much memory to allocate when you call
<tt class="cfunction">PyObject_New</tt>.

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
    0,
</pre></dl>

<P>
This has to do with variable length objects like lists and strings.
Ignore for now...

<P>
Now we get into the type methods, the things that make your objects
different from the others.  Of course, the Noddy object doesn't
implement many of these, but as mentioned above you have to implement
the deallocation function.

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
    noddy_noddy_dealloc, /*tp_dealloc*/
</pre></dl>

<P>
From here, all the type methods are nil so I won't go over them yet -
that's for the next section!

<P>
Everything else in the file should be familiar, except for this line
in <tt class="cfunction">initnoddy</tt>:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
    noddy_NoddyType.ob_type = &amp;PyType_Type;
</pre></dl>

<P>
This was alluded to above -- the <tt class="cdata">noddy_NoddyType</tt> object should
have type ``type'', but <code>&amp;PyType_Type</code> is not constant and so
can't be used in its initializer.  To work around this, we patch it up
in the module initialization.

<P>
That's it!  All that remains is to build it; put the above code in a
file called <span class="file">noddymodule.c</span> and

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
from distutils.core import setup, Extension
setup(name = "noddy", version = "1.0",
    ext_modules = [Extension("noddy", ["noddymodule.c"])])
</pre></dl>

<P>
in a file called <span class="file">setup.py</span>; then typing

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">
$ python setup.py build%$
</pre></dl>

<P>
at a shell should produce a file <span class="file">noddy.so</span> in a subdirectory;
move to that directory and fire up Python -- you should be able to
<code>import noddy</code> and play around with Noddy objects.

<P>
That wasn't so hard, was it?
